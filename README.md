Hi! I am Zahid Hasan. A passionate MERN Stack Developer. I studied B.Sc in CSE at Daffodil International University. I have matured knowledge in programming languages like C, JavaScript, TypeScript. I take a special interest in Back-end API design and development. Typically, I love to work with React.js, Node.js & GraphQL. I love to explore new technologies and tools. I'm flexible, proactive, and curious.
